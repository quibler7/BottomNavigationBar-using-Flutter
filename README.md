# BottomNavigationBar using Flutter

ðŸª„ I made a simple App containing BottomNavigationBar using GNav ( google nav bar ) 

ðŸ§  During this small project I leanred about padding and how to customise the Navigation Bar to match our App aesthetics. 

## Setup

Run the following commands from your terminal:

1) `git clone https://github.com/quibler7/BottomNavigationBar-using-Flutter` to clone this repository 

2) `flutter pub get` in the project root directory to install all the required dependencies.
